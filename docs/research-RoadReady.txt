## 0) What you’re building (in one sentence)

A “compliance command center” that turns messy driver/vehicle paperwork into a **single truth**: *who’s legal to operate today*, *what’s expiring soon*, and *what to fix next* — with **audit-ready evidence** and **no alert spam**.

---

## 1) Competitive landscape (what fleets actually use today)

### What mid-sized fleets (15–50 trucks) commonly do **right now**

They almost always run a **patchwork**:

* **Google Drive / Dropbox + spreadsheets** (manual trackers + folders)
* **ELD / telematics platform** (Samsara, Motive, Geotab, Omnitracs, etc.) for HOS + some document/qualification features
* **“Compliance specialists”** for DQF / drug & alcohol / audit support (J. J. Keller, Foley, etc.)
* **Inspection + maintenance tools** (Whip Around, Fleetio) for DVIRs, PM, inspection history

### Where spreadsheets + Drive fail (even if used “perfectly”)

* **No “current legality” signal**: A folder can be complete and still be expired.
* **No proactive logic**: You have to *remember* to check expiration dates (the “paperwork time bomb”).
* **No trustworthy audit trail**: Who uploaded/confirmed/changed what, and when?
* **No operational coupling**: “Driver is expired” doesn’t automatically trigger *do not dispatch* workflows.
* **No scalable retention rules**: HOS and supporting-doc retention has hard requirements (e.g., keep RODS + supporting docs **6 months**). ([FMCSA][1])

### What mid-sized fleets feel is missing (the gap you can own)

* A **simple Green/Yellow/Red** view across *drivers + vehicles* that is **always up to date**
* **Expiration extraction** from PDFs/photos without manual typing
* **Quiet, reliable reminders** (not “yet another notification system”)
* **One-click audit packets** (exportable, complete, time-stamped)

## 1A) Competitor comparison table (required deliverable)

> Pricing in this market is often **quote-based** or contract-dependent; when pricing isn’t published, I label it as “quote-based.” Where third parties estimate pricing, I flag it as *non-official*.

| Tool                            |               Typical target fleet size | Key compliance-relevant features                                                                   | Pricing reality                                                                                               | Why mid-sized fleets get unhappy                                                                                                         |

| **Samsara**                     |                       20+ to enterprise | Qualifications alerts for driver/asset docs; telematics + ELD ecosystem ([Samsara Help Center][2]) | **Quote-based** on website flow ([Samsara][3]) (3rd-party estimates ~$27–$33/vehicle/mo vary) ([Capterra][4]) | Powerful but can feel like “buy the whole suite”; compliance view is often *one module among many*; setup/standardization work remains   |
| **Motive (KeepTruckin)**        |                           small → large | Upload qualification docs; expiration alerts; workforce/qualifications tooling ([Motive][5])       | Pricing often varies; older tier references exist but may not reflect current contracts ([TechRadar][6])      | Great for ELD/telematics; doc compliance can still feel like “another page,” not the *command center*                                    |
| **J. J. Keller Encompass**      |                        mid → enterprise | Broad safety/compliance platform (ELD, DVIR, compliance workflows) ([Encompass][7])                | **Explicitly contact sales**; subscription varies ([Encompass][8])                                            | Strong compliance DNA, but can be heavyweight; implementations can feel enterprise-y                                                     |
| **Foley (Dash / Driver Files)** |                             small → mid | Digital DOT driver file management (DQF services + compliance support) ([Foley][9])                | Pricing page is **lead-form** (effectively quote-based) ([Foley][10])                                         | Often service-led; fleets still want a *daily operational dashboard* + alerts that match dispatch reality                                |
| **Tenstreet DQF**               | mid → large (recruiting-heavy carriers) | DQF tracking, missing/expired doc logic, bulk MVR workflows ([Tenstreet][11])                      | Typically **demo/quote** (no public pricing on DQF page) ([Tenstreet][11])                                    | Great DQF focus, but not the full “driver+vehicle compliance command center”; can be overkill if you’re not using their recruiting stack |
| **Whip Around**                 |                             small → mid | DOT-compliant inspection forms, photo capture, inspection history ([Capterra][12])                 | Pricing page exists but commonly tailored; third-party shows ~$5–$10 bands (not official) ([Whip Around][13]) | Excellent inspections, but not the end-to-end compliance dashboard (DQF, expirations, audit packets across everything)                   |
| **Fleetio**                     |                             small → mid | Inspections + maintenance records; strong ops tooling ([Fleetio][14])                              | **Published** from ~$4/vehicle/mo (plan dependent) ([Fleetio][14])                                            | Great maintenance; not purpose-built for DOT DQF + “legal to drive” gating                                                               |
| **Geotab**                      |                        mid → enterprise | Telematics, maintenance reminders, add-ins ([Geotab][15])                                          | Often reseller-priced; varies ([Tech.co][16])                                                                 | Strong platform, but compliance outcomes depend on configuration + process discipline                                                    |

**Your wedge (in Dave-language):** “I don’t want *another system*. I want **one screen** that tells me: *who is legal today* and *what will make me illegal next week* — with proof.”

---

## 2) Audit readiness (what “audit-ready” means for an MVP)

### What a DOT/FMCSA audit commonly demands access to (high-signal items)

You don’t need to boil the ocean Day-1. Start with the files that create the most “oh no” risk:

**A) Hours of Service evidence**

* Retain **RODS + supporting documents for 6 months** ([FMCSA][1])

**B) Vehicle inspection/maintenance records**

* You must maintain inspection/repair/maintenance records and retain them (commonly **1 year while controlled**, plus **6 months after** it leaves your control). ([Legal Information Institute][17])
* Annual/periodic inspection expectations (at least every 12 months) are highlighted in FMCSA safety-planner materials. ([CSA Compliance][18])

**C) Driver Qualification File (DQF) completeness**
DQF is where “paperwork time bomb” lives — annual checks, license/medical card, etc. A typical DQF checklist includes annual MVR/review and other required components. ([Tenstreet][11])

### “Audit-ready” MVP definition (realistic)

For Day-1, “audit-ready” should mean:

* Every uploaded doc has: **type**, **owner** (driver/vehicle), **issue/expiration dates**, **source file**, **uploaded by**, **uploaded at**
* Every extracted field has: **confidence** + **review status** (auto vs human-confirmed)
* One-click exports:

  * “All drivers: missing/expired/expiring soon”
  * “Driver packet” (zip/pdf bundle + index CSV)
  * “Vehicle packet” (same)

That’s enough to *reduce audit panic* without building enterprise compliance suites.

---

## 3) OCR & Document AI options (2026) + safe handling (required deliverable)

### Practical OCR options for a Day-1 MVP

| Option                                  | Accuracy (real-world)              |                                                                                                 Pricing | Integration   | Best for MVP                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Cloud Vision OCR**             | Very strong general OCR            |              First **1,000 units free/mo**, then **$1.50/1,000** (basic OCR tiers) ([Google Cloud][19]) | Easy API      | Best “fast and good enough” OCR backbone      |
| **AWS Textract**                        | Strong, especially structured docs | Per-page pricing varies by feature; official pricing is feature-based ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][20]) | Medium        | Good if you’re already AWS-first              |
| **Azure Document Intelligence**         | Strong layout + extraction         |                        Azure has per-page pricing models (varies by model/tier) ([Microsoft Azure][21]) | Medium        | Good if you’re Microsoft ecosystem            |
| **Google Document AI**                  | More “doc understanding”           |          Example: **$0.10 for 1–10 pages** in examples (processor/model dependent) ([Google Cloud][22]) | Medium        | Overkill Day-1 unless you need richer parsing |
| **Open-source (Tesseract / PaddleOCR)** | Variable; depends on image quality |                                              Free (compute cost only); Apache 2.0 ([Tesseract OCR][23]) | Higher effort | Good later if cost/privacy push you on-prem   |

### Recommended OCR strategy (required deliverable)

**Primary (Day-1): Google Cloud Vision OCR**

* Reason: cheapest “high trust” path to *working extraction fast* with low ops burden. ([Google Cloud][19])

**Fallback strategy (human-in-the-loop)**

* Any time the system is unsure, it should **ask for confirmation** (in your admin UI), not guess.
* Store both:

  1. the **raw OCR text**
  2. the **final confirmed fields** (with reviewer + timestamp)

**Confidence thresholds (simple + safe)**

* **Document type classification**

  * If confidence < **0.85** → “Needs Review: Document Type”
* **Expiration date extraction**

  * If no unambiguous date found OR confidence < **0.90** → “Needs Review: Expiration”
* **Key identifiers** (license #, DOT #, VIN)

  * If confidence < **0.92** → “Needs Review: Identifier”

> The exact numeric thresholds are adjustable, but the principle is non-negotiable: **low confidence never auto-changes compliance status**.

### Safe-to-cut corners at MVP (OCR edition)

* Don’t build “perfect parsing.” Start with **10–15 doc types** you care about most (CDL, med card, insurance, registration, annual inspection, etc.).
* Avoid handwriting Day-1 unless absolutely required.
* No custom model training Day-1.

---

## 4) Alerts & notifications (email + SMS) without spam

### Low-cost, low-hassle setup (early SaaS)

* **Email**

  * **Amazon SES** is extremely cheap ($0.10/1,000 emails) but more setup (DNS, reputation). ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][24])
  * **Resend** is very “developer-friendly,” generous free tier, quick setup. ([Resend][25])
* **SMS**

  * **Twilio** is the simplest default; US SMS starts around **$0.0083** send/receive. ([Twilio][26])
  * AWS SNS can be cost-effective but has more moving parts; pricing details vary and require careful setup. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][27])

### Best practices to avoid “alert fatigue” while staying valuable

* **One “Daily Digest” by default** (Yellow items + new Reds), plus **immediate** alerts only for “Red = illegal to operate”
* **Escalation ladder**

  * T-30 days: email digest only
  * T-14 days: email + optional SMS
  * T-7 days: email + SMS
  * Expired: immediate SMS + email to safety manager (and optionally dispatch)
* **De-duplication**: never alert twice for the same doc within 24h unless status worsens.

---

## 5) MVP architecture (beginner-friendly) + recommended stack (required deliverable)

### The simplest reliable MVP pipeline

1. **Upload**

   * User uploads PDF/photo → stored in object storage
2. **Classify + Extract**

   * OCR → text
   * Extract expiration date + identifiers
   * Assign doc to driver/vehicle
3. **Review queue**

   * If confidence low → human confirms fields
4. **Status engine**

   * Green/Yellow/Red computed from *confirmed* fields (or high-confidence auto fields)
5. **Alerts**

   * Scheduled job runs daily + event-triggered on “Red”
6. **Audit export**

   * Driver packet + Vehicle packet + CSV index

### Recommended MVP tech stack (vibe-coder friendly)

| Layer              | Recommended                                            | Why                                                    | Alternatives                                                     |

| Background jobs    | **Inngest**-style workflow (or Supabase cron + worker) | Retries + visibility                                   | Trigger.dev, BullMQ                                              |
| Hosting            | **Vercel** (frontend) + Supabase                       | Low ops burden                                         | Render, Fly.io                                                   |
| OCR                | **Google Vision OCR**                                  | Fast, strong, cheap at MVP volume ([Google Cloud][19]) | Textract ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][20])                       |
| Email              | **Resend** (fast) → SES later                          | Low friction                                           | SES ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][24]), Postmark ([Postmark][28]) |
| SMS                | **Twilio**                                             | Dead simple; predictable cost ([Twilio][26])           | AWS SNS ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][27])                        |

### Estimated monthly cost (MVP scale)

* **Best-case** (low volume): ~$20–$80/mo
* **Worst-case within your budget** (more docs + SMS): ~$120–$200/mo
  (Full breakdown in Section 10.)

---

## 6) MVP feature scope (required deliverable)

### Must-have (Day-1)

* Upload PDFs/photos
* Doc type + expiration extraction + manual review queue
* Driver/Vehicle profile pages with doc list
* Green/Yellow/Red logic
* Email + SMS alerts with escalation
* Audit export (packet + CSV index)
* Full audit trail (who/when)

### Explicitly defer (say “no” on purpose)

* Driver mobile app
* Deep integrations (ELD/TMS APIs)
* Automated “dispatch block” enforcement
* Custom model training
* Multi-tenant enterprise controls (SSO, RBAC granularity)
* Complex workflows (e.g., multi-step approvals)

---

## 7) Pricing & monetization (simple, trust-based)

### What “cheap vs expensive” feels like in this category

* Telematics suites often land around **tens of dollars per vehicle/month** in common market discussions (and can be contract-based). ([Capterra][4])
* Maintenance/inspection-only tools can be **single-digit $/vehicle/month** (Fleetio published: ~$4/vehicle/mo entry plan). ([Fleetio][14])

### Suggested MVP pricing tiers (keep it dead simple)

* **Starter** (up to 15 trucks): **$99/mo**
* **Growth** (16–50 trucks): **$199/mo**
* Add-on: **SMS pack** (e.g., $20/mo includes X messages; overage pass-through)

Positioning: You’re selling **10 hours/week back + “I can sleep” peace of mind**, not OCR.

---

## 8) AI acceleration (how to use AI without sacrificing trust)

Where AI helps most (fast + safe):

* **Generate schemas + migrations** (drivers, vehicles, documents, events)
* **Document classification** from OCR text (with confidence)
* **Field extraction** (expiration date, doc ID) with structured output
* **Validation**: AI proposes; system enforces rules (“date must be future,” “CDL format,” etc.)
* **UI copy + onboarding checklists** (reduce time to usable)

Rule: AI can suggest; **only deterministic logic (or human confirmation) changes compliance status**.

---

## 9) Development roadmap (Weeks 1–6) (required deliverable)

### Week 1 — “Upload works”

* Auth + org setup
* Driver/Vehicle tables
* File upload + storage
* Basic document list UI

### Week 2 — “OCR + extraction works”
