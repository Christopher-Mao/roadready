# Resources (Optional)

## Product thinking
- Keep it “one screen = truth”
- Default to “daily digest” to avoid alert fatigue

## Implementation references
- Supabase RLS patterns (simple “user owns fleet”)
- Vercel cron calling Next.js route
- Resend transactional email sending
- Twilio SMS sending

(For MVP, rely on official docs + minimal dependencies.)
